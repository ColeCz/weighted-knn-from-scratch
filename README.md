# Weighted k-Nearest Neighbors (k-NN) from Scratch

This project implements a **Weighted k-Nearest Neighbors** algorithm from scratch using **NumPy**. It applies the model to the **MNIST** handwritten digit dataset for classification tasks.

## Why Weighted k-NN?

This is mainly to get me back in the ML headspace after a year break. I wanted to perform some classification task with a model I can implement from scratch and tweak and ponder. This was a great sandbox to refresh my terminology, numpy syntax, model intuition, and model/hyperparameter curiousity.

## Features

- k-NN classifier coded for mnist
- weighted distance to reduce the impact of outliers and increase accuracy with higher k values
- Logs average distances for better analysis
- Optimized using NumPy for faster computation

---

## Issues
- I can't run this enough to graph k values and their accuracy, I have not setup Google Colab or another environment.
